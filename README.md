# Bloomington EOC Citizen Report Simulator
Included here is the source code for the web-based dashboard that shows an annotated Google Map that displays information about all of the citizen-generated reports made by users.

The dashboard can be viewed online: https://su20-i516-final-eoc.web.app/

The reports can be generated from multiple sources.  The website has buttons that allow you to simulate a report submission from an outside source.

## Companion Android App
I've also created an Android application ([source code here](https://github.com/su20-elliott-i516/android_bton_citizen_reporter)) that allows users to submit a report.  Using the Android application will update the web-based dashboard in real time.
